# CVE-2023-24042 demo

Docker and docker-compose are required to run the demo environment. Python is required to run the exploit script.

Execute `docker-compose up` while in this directory to build the image and run it. The port 8021 on localhost is forwarded to
the FTP server, while port range 50000-50099 is used for data connections. There is an `anonymous` user which accepts any non-empty password
and has readonly access to the `/home/ftpuser/ftpshare` directory only. There is a single file in the directory, called `hello.txt`.

Example invocation of the script, which prints the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file in the container:
```bash
python exploit_cve_2023_24042.py 127.0.0.1:8021 anonymous a hello.txt /etc/passwd
```
